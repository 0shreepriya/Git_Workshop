What is git and What is gitHub

Introduction: What is GIT?
Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system(VCS), which is designed to
handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and eï¬€iciency.

VCS ?? 
version control system is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

GitHub:
GitHub is a web platform for collaborative software development using version control, enabling developers to manage and share code, track changes, and work together on projects.

so why Git ?
Git is like a time machine for your code. It helps you keep track of changes you make, lets multiple people work on the same project without messing up each other's work, and makes it easy to go back in time if you make a mistake. 

What is a repositor? A repository (repo for short) is a place where your project files and their history live. It's like a folder for your project that Git can track and help you manage. Repositories start out empty - you add your initial project files and begin tracking and committing changes.

creating a repositry: Open GitHub.com and click the + icon in the top right corner and select "New repository". Give your repository a name, optionally add a description, choose if you want it public or private, and select whether to initialize the repository with a README file. Once


How to clone a repository? Cloning a repository copies the entire history of the project. It downloads a project and its entire code history. This is useful if you want to contribute to an existing project or want to use a project as a starting point for your own idea. To clone a repository:

why fork ? Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea. Forking a repository also lets you contribute back to the original without having to ask for write access.
